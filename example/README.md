# CloudSim Plus Automation Example

This is an example project showing how to use CloudSim Plus as a maven dependency.
This way, it allows your own application to load simulation scenarios from YAML files
and automate the creation and execution of them in CloudSim Plus.

If you just want to load YAML simulation scenarios from the command line,
check the documentation at the upper directory.
